# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Troll

A mischievous twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where the AI refuses to let you win easily! This React-based game features dynamic grid sizes, intelligent AI opponent, and a cheeky "anti-win" mechanism that will keep you on your toes.

## üéØ Features

### üé≤ Dynamic Grid Sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With
- **React 18**: Modern functional components with hooks
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features

### Key Components
- **Dynamic Grid System**: Scalable board generation
- **AI Decision Engine**: Multi-strategy move calculation
- **Win Detection Algorithm**: Efficient pattern matching
- **Animation System**: CSS transitions and transforms

### State Management
- **Game Board**: Array-based grid representation
- **Move History**: Complete game move tracking
- **Animation States**: Smooth transition management
- **Statistics**: Real-time game analytics

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### AI Strategy Hierarchy
1. **Block Winning Moves**: Prevent immediate player wins
2. **Seek Victory**: Take winning opportunities when available
3. **Control Center**: Occupy strategic center positions
4. **Secure Corners**: Prefer corner positions over edges
5. **Random Selection**: Fallback for remaining moves

### Troll Detection Logic
The AI monitors for these "about to win" patterns:
- **Rows**: 2 X's + 1 empty space in any row
- **Columns**: 2 X's + 1 empty space in any column
- **Diagonals**: 2 X's + 1 empty space in either diagonal

### Animation Sequence
1. **Detection**: AI identifies near-win state
2. **Brief Display**: Shows player's move for 500ms
3. **Animation**: 2-second pulse and rotation effect
4. **Reset**: Board clears to empty state
5. **Popup**: "Not That Easy!" message displays
6. **Resume**: Game continues with fresh board

## üé® Customization

### Styling
- **Grid Sizes**: Modify `squareSize` and `fontSize` variables
- **Colors**: Update Tailwind classes for different themes
- **Animations**: Adjust duration and effects in CSS classes

### Gameplay
- **Grid Options**: Add more size options in the `changeGridSize` function
- **AI Difficulty**: Modify strategy priorities in `getAIMove`
- **Troll Sensitivity**: Adjust detection logic in `isXAboutToWin`

### Visual Effects
- **Popup Messages**: Customize text and emojis in the popup component
- **Animation Timing**: Modify `setTimeout` delays for different pacing
- **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for moves and resets

## üêõ Known Issues

- **Rapid Clicking**: Multiple clicks during AI thinking may cause issues
- **Animation Interruption**: Changing grid size during animation may cause visual glitches
